Crafty Entity Box Overlays
==========================

This Crafty component shows boxes around entities to visualize
the effects of entity rotation.

By default three boxes are shown:

1. default entity coordinates and width/height without rotation applied
2. default entity coordinates and width/height with rotation applied
3. minimum bounding rectangle of the rotated entity

See <http://jsfiddle.net/At2vq/2/> for a demonstration.
